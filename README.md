## Overview

This paper presents EasyRAG, a simple, lightweight, and efficient retrieval-augmented generation framework for automated network operations. Our framework has three advantages. The first is accurate question answering. We designed a straightforward RAG scheme based on (1) a specific data processing workflow (2) dual-route sparse retrieval for coarse ranking (3) LLM Reranker for reranking (4) LLM answer generation and optimization. This approach achieved first place in the GLM4 track in the preliminary round and second place in the GLM4 track in the semifinals. The second is simple deployment. Our method primarily consists of BM25 retrieval and BGE-reranker reranking, requiring no fine-tuning of any models, occupying minimal VRAM, easy to deploy, and highly scalable; we provide a flexible code library with various search and generation strategies, facilitating custom process implementation. The last one is efficient inference. We designed an efficient inference acceleration scheme for the entire coarse ranking, reranking, and generation process that significantly reduces the inference latency of RAG while maintaining a good level of accuracy; each acceleration scheme can be plug-and-play into any component of the RAG process, consistently enhancing the efficiency of the RAG system.

## Requirements

EasyRAG needs Python3.10.14 and at least 1 GPU with 16GB. 

You need to change `llm_keys` in `src/easyrag.yaml` to your GLM keys.

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
bash scripts/download.sh # download models
bash scripts/process.sh # process zedx data

```

## Reproduce

### 1. Run Directly

```bash
cd src
# run challenge questions
python3 main.py 
# copy answer file
cp submit_result.jsonl ../answer.jsonl
```

### 2. Run with Docker

```bash
chmod +x scripts/run.sh
./scripts/run.sh
```

## Usage

### 1. API

```bash
cd src
uvicorn api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --workers 1
```

### 2.WebUI

You need to run the API first

```bash
cd src
streamlit run webui.py
```
